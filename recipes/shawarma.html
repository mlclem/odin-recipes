        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 skinless and boneless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>2 unwaxed lemons</li>
            <li>100ml/3½fl oz olive oil</li>
            <li>4 fat or 6 smaller garlic cloves, finely grated or minced</li>
            <li>2 dried or fresh bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried chilli flakes</li>
            <li>¼ tsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>¼ tsp freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>2 tsp sea salt flakes</li>
            <li>lettuce leaves, to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Take a large resealable freezer bag and put the chicken thighs in it. Using a fine grater, preferably a microplane, grate in the lemon zest. Squeeze the lemons and add the juice. Pour in the olive oil and add the garlic, then add all the remaining ingredients.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Squish everything about together, then seal the bag, place it on a plate or in a dish, and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, or up to 1 day.</li>
            <br>
            <li>When you’re ready to cook, preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Remove the chicken from the fridge and allow it to reach room temperature.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Tip the contents of the freezer bag into a shallow roasting tin and make sure all the chicken thighs are lying flat and not on top of one another (if possible) before roasting in the hot oven for 30 minutes, by which time they should be cooked through (though obviously you must check) and golden on top.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Cut the thighs into chunky slices rather than leaving them whole.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add the chicken, lettuce and your favourite sauces to a wrap or flat bread and tuck in!</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <p>The chicken can be marinated 1 day ahead. Store in fridge until needed. The chicken can be frozen in its marinade – as long as the meat has not been previously frozen – for up to 3 months. Leftover chicken can also be frozen, in airtight containers or resealable bags, for up to 2 months. Defrost overnight in fridge before using.
